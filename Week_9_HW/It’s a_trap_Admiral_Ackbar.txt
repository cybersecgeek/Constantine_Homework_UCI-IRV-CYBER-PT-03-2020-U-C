Mission 1




The Resistance (starwars.com) is able to send emails but unable to receive any because asltx.l.google.com is a valid record and  asltx.2.google.com is not.

Mission 2

v=spf1 a mx mx:smtp.secureserver.net include:aspmx.googlemail.com ip4:104.156.250.80 ip4:45.63.15.159 ip4:45.63.4.215

The new ip (45.23.176.21) is not included in the SFP records.
This is why the emails are going to the [:::spam::::] folder.

#      Now I am hungry and want some SPAM.
#      pause()
#      Well we can't have everything...
#      Will check the Cantina later.
