`nmap -sV -oN zenmapscan.txt --script smb-enum-shares 192.168.0.10`

?

- Zenmap vulnerability script command:


    nmap --script smb-enum-shares 192.168.0.10

    ?


- Once you have identified this vulnerability, answer the following questions for your client:

  1. What is the vulnerability:
    anonymous user have read/write  rights in samba shares.

  2. Why is it dangerous:

  anonymous users can read/write in samba shares.


  3. What mitigation strategies can you recommendations for the client to protect their server:
